## Vulnerability Reporting

Contact our Security Team to share details of your security vulnerability: [Contact Info] (https://www.tele.studio/security-report)

Please include as much information as possible, including the detailed steps to reproduce the problem, the versions affected, and expected and actual results. In addition, please include any other information that might assist us in responding more quickly and efficiently.

A proof-of-concept script or exploit, rather than screenshots and videos, tends to be preferred over text-based descriptions.

A detailed description of the process can be found on our [Responsible Disclosure] (https://www.tele.studio/security-report) page. This page includes information such as:
 - Our Incident Response Procedure (what will happen after you report an issue) - Our Rules (what you can and cannot do while researching security issues) - Guidelines on DO REPORT and DO NOT REPORT issues (which issues will be accepted and rejected)
